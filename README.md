# Photorama - My svelte app

This is a project  type "proof of concept". This is an one-page app in form of photo-catalog;
 
each photo can be chosen and added to wish-list (favourites) or/and to the cart and can be 

removed from there as well.



## Get started

Clone the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/petelina17/photorama.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd photorama
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
